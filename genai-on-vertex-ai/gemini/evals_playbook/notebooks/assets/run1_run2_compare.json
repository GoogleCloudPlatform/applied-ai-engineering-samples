however , their findings were inconsistent . the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . furthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together , it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning . it is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression . given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety . furthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship . seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) . the cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney . inclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) . patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment . ten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) . patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) . thus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition . this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants . self - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd . a cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) . this criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups . the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way this was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) . processing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) . attentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) . working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) . language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) . the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) demographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions . chi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups . all analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed . spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions . as expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) . groups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) . additionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) . there were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) . the pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . neither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups . logical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups . there were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) . participants were split into lpd and rpd , and then further group differences were examined between pda+ and pda. importantly , the groups remained matched in age , disease duration , updrs - iii , dde , h&y stage , and depression but remained significantly different on self - reported anxiety . lpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span forward test ( t(19 ) = 2.29 , p = 0.033 ) compared to lpda , whereas rpda+ demonstrated worse performance on the digit span backward test ( u = 36.5 , p = 0.006 ) , lm - i immediate recall ( u = 37.5 , p = 0.008 ) , and lm - ii ( u = 45.0 , p = 0.021 ) but not lm % retention ( u = 75.5 , p = 0.39 ) compared to rpda. this study is the first to directly compare cognition between pd patients with and without anxiety . the findings confirmed our hypothesis that anxiety negatively influences attentional set - shifting and working memory in pd . more specifically , we found that pd patients with anxiety were more impaired on the trail making test part b which assessed attentional set - shifting , on both digit span tests which assessed working memory and attention , and to a lesser extent on the logical memory test which assessed memory and new verbal learning compared to pd patients without anxiety . taken together , these findings suggest that anxiety in pd may reduce processing capacity and impair processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory in a similar way as seen in young healthy adults [ 26 , 27 ] . although the neurobiology of anxiety in pd remains unknown , many researchers have postulated that anxiety disorders are related to neurochemical changes that occur during the early , premotor stages of pd - related degeneration [ 37 , 38 ] such as nigrostriatal dopamine depletion , as well as cell loss within serotonergic and noradrenergic brainstem nuclei ( i.e. , raphe nuclei and locus coeruleus , resp . , which provide massive inputs to corticolimbic regions ) . over time , chronic dysregulation of adrenocortical and catecholamine functions can lead to hippocampal damage as well as dysfunctional prefrontal neural circuitries [ 39 , 40 ] , which play a key role in memory and attention . recent functional neuroimaging work has suggested that enhanced hippocampal activation during executive functioning and working memory tasks may represent compensatory processes for impaired frontostriatal functions in pd patients compared to controls . therefore , chronic stress from anxiety , for example , may disrupt compensatory processes in pd patients and explain the cognitive impairments specifically in working memory and attention seen in pd patients with anxiety . it has also been suggested that hyperactivation within the putamen may reflect a compensatory striatal mechanism to maintain normal working memory performance in pd patients ; however , losing this compensatory activation has been shown to contribute to poor working memory performance . anxiety in mild pd has been linked to reduced putamen dopamine uptake which becomes more extensive as the disease progresses . this further supports the notion that anxiety may disrupt compensatory striatal mechanisms as well , providing another possible explanation for the cognitive impairments observed in pd patients with anxiety in this study . noradrenergic and serotonergic systems should also be considered when trying to explain the mechanisms by which anxiety may influence cognition in pd . although these neurotransmitter systems are relatively understudied in pd cognition , treating the noradrenergic and serotonergic systems has shown beneficial effects on cognition in pd . selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , citalopram , was shown to improve response inhibition deficits in pd , while noradrenaline reuptake blocker , atomoxetine , has been recently reported to have promising effects on cognition in pd [ 45 , 46 ] . overall , very few neuroimaging studies have been conducted in pd in order to understand the neural correlates of pd anxiety and its underlying neural pathology . future research should focus on relating anatomical changes and neurochemical changes to neural activation in order to gain a clearer understanding on how these pathologies affect anxiety in pd . to further understand how anxiety and cognitive dysfunction are related , future research should focus on using advanced structural and function imaging techniques to explain both cognitive and neural breakdowns that are associated with anxiety in pd patients . research has indicated that those with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who have more neuropsychiatric symptoms have a greater risk of developing dementia compared to those with fewer neuropsychiatric symptoms . future studies should also examine whether treating neuropsychiatric symptoms might impact the progression of cognitive decline and improve cognitive impairments in pd patients . previous studies have used pd symptom laterality as a window to infer asymmetrical dysfunction of neural circuits . for example , lpd patients have greater inferred right hemisphere pathology , whereas rpd patients have greater inferred left hemisphere pathology . thus , cognitive domains predominantly subserved by the left hemisphere ( e.g. , verbally mediated tasks of executive function and verbal memory ) might be hypothesized to be more affected in rpd than lpd ; however , this remains controversial . it has also been suggested that since anxiety is a common feature of left hemisphere involvement [ 48 , 49 ] , cognitive domains subserved by the left hemisphere may also be more strongly related to anxiety . results from this study showed selective verbal memory deficits in rpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd without anxiety , whereas lpd patients with anxiety had greater attentional / working memory deficits compared to lpd without anxiety . although these results align with previous research , interpretations of these findings should be made with caution due to the small sample size in the lpd comparison specifically . recent work has suggested that the hads questionnaire may underestimate the burden of anxiety related symptomology and therefore be a less sensitive measure of anxiety in pd [ 30 , 50 ] . in addition , our small sample size also limited the statistical power for detecting significant findings . based on these limitations , our findings are likely conservative and underrepresent the true impact anxiety has on cognition in pd . additionally , the current study employed a very brief neuropsychological assessment including one or two tests for each cognitive domain . future studies are encouraged to collect a more complex and comprehensive battery from a larger sample of pd participants in order to better understand the role anxiety plays on cognition in pd . another limitation of this study was the absence of diagnostic interviews to characterize participants ' psychiatric symptoms and specify the type of anxiety disorders included in this study . future studies should perform diagnostic interviews with participants ( e.g. , using dsm - v criteria ) rather than relying on self - reported measures to group participants , in order to better understand whether the type of anxiety disorder ( e.g. , social anxiety , phobias , panic disorders , and generalized anxiety ) influences cognitive performance differently in pd . one advantage the hads questionnaire provided over other anxiety scales was that it assessed both anxiety and depression simultaneously and allowed us to control for coexisting depression . although there was a trend that the pda+ group self - reported higher levels of depression than the pda group , all participants included in the study scored < 6 on the depression subscale of the hads . controlling for depression while assessing anxiety has been identified as a key shortcoming in the majority of recent work . considering many previous studies have investigated the influence of depression on cognition in pd without accounting for the presence of anxiety and the inconsistent findings reported to date , we recommend that future research should try to disentangle the influence of anxiety versus depression on cognitive impairments in pd . considering the growing number of clinical trials for treating depression , there are few if any for the treatment of anxiety in pd . anxiety is a key contributor to decreased quality of life in pd and greatly requires better treatment options . moreover , anxiety has been suggested to play a key role in freezing of gait ( fog ) , which is also related to attentional set - shifting [ 52 , 53 ] . future research should examine the link between anxiety , set - shifting , and fog , in order to determine whether treating anxiety might be a potential therapy for improving fog ..

Here's what we did and what we found:\n\n* **Purpose:** We wanted to see if anxiety makes thinking skills worse in people with Parkinson's disease, even when depression is not present.\n* **Research:** We compared the thinking and memory skills of two groups of people with Parkinson's: one group with anxiety and one group without anxiety. We made sure that none of the participants had depression.\n* **Findings:**  \n    * People with Parkinson's and anxiety had a harder time switching between tasks and holding information in their minds compared to those without anxiety. \n    * This suggests that anxiety might overload the brain's ability to process information in Parkinson's.\n* **Implications:**\n    * **For patients:** If you have Parkinson's and anxiety, it's important to talk to your doctor. Anxiety can worsen thinking problems, but treatments for anxiety might help.\n    * **Future research:** We need more research to understand exactly how anxiety affects the brain in Parkinson's and to find the best ways to treat anxiety in this group. \n", "output_text_b": "This article investigates the impact of anxiety on cognitive function in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD).  The authors highlight that while both anxiety and depression are common in PD, anxiety has been less studied, despite evidence suggesting it has a greater impact on quality of life. \n\nThe study involved comparing cognitive performance between two groups of PD patients: those with anxiety (PDA+) and those without (PDA-). The results showed that PDA+ patients performed significantly worse in tests assessing attentional set-shifting and working memory compared to PDA- patients. This suggests that anxiety may hinder processing capacity and efficiency in PD, particularly in areas related to attention and working memory.\n\nThe authors propose several potential neurological explanations for these findings, including:\n\n* **Disruption of compensatory mechanisms:** Anxiety might disrupt the brain's attempts to compensate for declining cognitive function in PD, particularly in the hippocampus and putamen.\n* **Neurochemical imbalances:** Alterations in dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline systems, all implicated in anxiety, could contribute to cognitive deficits.\n\nThe study also explored the influence of symptom laterality (whether PD symptoms are more prominent on the left or right side of the body) on the relationship between anxiety and cognition. While the findings showed some differences between left-dominant and right-dominant PD patients, the small sample size limited the interpretation of these results.\n\nThe authors acknowledge several limitations, including the reliance on self-reported anxiety measures, a limited neuropsychological assessment, and the lack of diagnostic interviews to confirm specific anxiety disorders. They recommend future research address these limitations and investigate the effectiveness of anxiety treatments on cognitive function and quality of life in PD.\n\nOverall, this study provides valuable insights into the detrimental impact of anxiety on cognition in PD. It emphasizes the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms and develop effective interventions to address anxiety and improve cognitive outcomes in this population. \n", "score": 0.0, "individual_rater_scores": [{"is_flipped": false, "score": 0.5, "rating_label": "A is slightly better", "rationale": "Both Responses accurately summarize the article.

interacting rna ) and snorna ( small nucleolar rna ) . mirnas are a class of multifunctional singled - stranded small rna which are ~20  nt in length and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger rna depending on the base - pairing complementarity between the mirna and its target mrna [ 1 , 2 ] . although over 1,000 mirna sequences have been identified from the tissues or cells of human origin and other species , as many as 1,000 to 10,000 mirnas per genome have been predicted [ 3 , 4 ] . mirnas regulate a broad range of biological processes including timing of development , cell cycle progression , stem cell self - renewal , differentiation , cancer initiation , cancer cell proliferation , metastasis and apoptosis [ 511 ] . cancer is caused by multiple processes including uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inappropriate survival of apoptotic cells . many regulatory factors switch on or off genes that govern cell division and direct cellular proliferation . mirnas regulate gene expression and play important roles in the onset and progression of tumorigenesis . emerging evidence demonstrates the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis , functioning either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes . although the current treatment of radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormone therapy slow mammary gland tumor growth , prolong survival and improve the quality of patients life , metastatic breast cancer still remains incurable due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tumorigenesis and metastasis occur . as small non - coding rnas regulate gene expression and tumorigenesis , they may represent a novel cancer therapy . unlike mrna , mirnas are transcribed but never translated . some mirnas are transcribed from non - coding regions between genes , deriving from independent transcription unit . other mirnas are transcribed together with coding mrnas from the coding region of the genome , deriving from the introns of gene transcripts [ 13 , 14 ] . mirna gene copy number gain / loss and mirna gene mutation have been observed in breast cancer resulting in the aberrant expression of mirna . the first study about the altered expression of mirnas in human breast cancer patients and human breast cancer cell lines was reported in 2005 by lorio et al . , in which 29 mirnas were identified with aberrant expression based on microarray and northern blot analysis of 76 breast tumor samples and 14 human breast cell lines . zhang and colleagues analyzed 283 human mirna genes on 55 human breast primary tumors and 18 human breast cancer cell lines using array - based comparative genomic hybridization . the results demonstrated a high frequency ( ~72.8% ) of gene copy number abnormality in mirna - containing regions in human breast cancer . wang et al . collected 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and examined the expression of selected mirnas in tumor and adjacent non - tumor tissues . mir-21 , mir-106a and mir-155 were significantly over - expressed in the tumor specimens compared with normal controls , whereas mir-126 , mir-199a and mir-335 were significantly decreased in expression in the tumor samples . our studies of the mir-17 - 92 cluster demonstrated decreased expression of mir-17/20 in human breast cancer specimens compared with matching normal breast tissue from the same patient . subsequent analysis identified reduced mir-17/20 expression in node - positive compared with node - negative breast cancers and demonstrated that mir-17/20 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion via a heterotypic signaling . although the tendency for a global decrease of mirna expression in human cancers originally suggested a general tumor suppressor function of mirnas , subsequent studies showing the aberrant expression of specific mirnas in breast cancer suggest mirna - specific roles in breast cancer onset and progression . many distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation , apoptosis , cancer stem cell expansion , and tumorigenesis . mirna may function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cell type , culture conditions , target genes and pathway . the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been reviewed recently [ 21 , 22 ] . le et al . described the expression pattern and regulatory network of key mirnas in breast cancer , including let-7 , mir-34 , mir-125 , mir-200 family , mir-205 , mir-21 , mir-10 and the mir-17 - 92 cluster . adams et al . reviewed the mirna regulation of estrogen signaling pathway and erbb2/her signaling pathway in breast cancer . the understanding of how mirnas are involved in breast cancer through regulating the cell cycle remains rudimentary . herein we summarize the recent literature and research progress on the mechanism by which mirnas regulate the breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation ( fig . 1mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint cyclin d1 is either overexpressed or amplified in ~50% of breast cancer . the abundance of cyclin d1 is rate - limiting in breast cancer cellular proliferation and g1-s phase transition [ 23 , 24 ] . in addition , cyclin d1 is a critical downstream target of erbb2- , ras- and -catenin- induced breast cancers , and is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumors when targeted to the mammary gland of mice . antisense inhibition of cyclin d1 expression in vivo suppressed the growth of neut - transformed mammary adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice . conserved sequences of the cyclin d1 3utr contain potential binding sites for multiple mirnas including mir-17/20/106 , mir-15/16 , mir-23 and let-7 . mir-17/20 binds the cyclin d1 3utr , inhibiting the expression of cyclin d1 , resulting in cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase and suppression of mcf-7 cell proliferation [ 18 , 26 ] . the regulation of cyclin d1 expression by mir-17 - 92 , as well as mir-15/16 , was confirmed by deshpande et al . . the let-7 family functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancers including lung , colon , ovarian   and breast cancer . schultz et al . demonstrated the downregulation of cyclin d1 by mirna let-7 in control of cancer cell growth . the regulation of cyclin d1 by mirna is likely of broad importance as cyclin d1 encodes the regulatory subunit of a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the prb family proteins to inhibit dna synthesis , and phosphorylates nuclear respiratory factor 1 ( nrf-1 ) to inhibit mitochondria biogenesis [ 32 , 33 ] . furthermore , cyclin d1 promotes breast epithelial cell angiogenesis and migration , and promotes chromosomal instability which in turn contributes to tumorigenesis . the mir-221/222 cluster regulates the cell cycle , cell growth and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in breast cancer . mir-221/222 inhibited p27 and p57 abundance , facilitating g1-s phase transition , thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation [ 36 , 37 ] . moreover , mir-221/222 may contribute to the aggressive clinical behavior of basal - like breast cancers . the breast cancer basal - like subtype - specific mirnas , mir-221 and mir-222 , promote emt in breast cancer by targeting trps1 ( trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 ) which inhibits emt by repressing zeb2 expression . mir-221 and/or mir-222 expression in mcf-7 and t47d breast cancer cells decreased er expression associated with tamoxifen resistance . the onco - mirna mir-21 is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer [ 40 , 41 ] . mir-21 induced cellular proliferation , migration , invasion , emt , cancer stem cell characteristics and chemotherapy resistance in human breast cancer [ 42 , 43 ] . high mir-21 level is associated with poor prognosis , advanced stage , positive lymph node status and reduced survival time in breast cancer . mir-21 promotes mcf-7 cellular proliferation in part through inhibiting the expression of a tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death 4 ( pdcd4 ) . in colon cancer , mir-21 participates in a dna damage - induced g2-m checkpoint through suppressing the cell cycle regulator cdc25a . a recent report demonstrated the mir-21 regulates the cell cycle through targeting cdc25a in mcf-7 breast cancer cells . with a potential anti - cancer chemical 3,3-diindolylmethane treatment , mir-27a expression is upregulated in human breast cancer cell lines . in mda - mb-231 cells , mir-27a negatively regulated the zinc finger zbtb10 gene and myt-1 , thereby promoting breast cancer cell proliferation . mir-27a suppressed myt-1 , increased cdc2/cyclin b activity and promoted the g2-m checkpoint in mda - mb-231 cells . thus , distinct mirnas affect key genetic targets that govern distinct cell - cycle checkpoints including cyclins , cdks , cdk inhibitors and the g2-m regulation apparatus . in addition to cell - cycle control , breast tumor onset and progression and breast tumor stem cells are also regulated by distinct mirnas . cancer stem cells ( cscs ) are characterized by their self - renewal capacity , an ability to differentiate into non - tumorigenic cell progeny , and their ability to seed tumors when transplanted into animal hosts . cell surface markers such as cd44 , cd24 , cd133 , epithelial - specific antigen and aldehyde dehydrogenase-1 are frequently used to isolate and enrich cscs . the involvement of mirnas in regulating tumor formation by cscs or tumor - initiating cells ( t - ic ) has been widely investigated . let-7 expression is very low to undetectable level in embryonic stem cells ( es cells ) and increases with differentiation . a comparison of mirna expression between breast t - ic and non - t - ic demonstrated reduced let-7 expression in t - ic and increased abundance with differentiation . transduction of breast cscs with let-7 reduced the proportion of undifferentiated cells , inhibited cell proliferation , mammosphere formation , and tumor formation in vivo . clarke and colleagues identified 37 mirnas which were differentially expressed between human breast cscs ( cd44cd24lineage ) and lineage nontumorigenic breast cancer cells . the mir-200 family members were downregulated in human breast cscs and normal mammary stem / progenitor cells . expression of mir-200 inhibited breast cancer stem cell expansion in vitro , and suppressed the tumor formation ability of human breast cancer stem cell in vivo . ectopic mir-34c expression reduced breast t - ics self - renewal , inhibited emt and suppressed tumor cell invasiveness via silencing notch4 . zhu et al . found the reduced mir-128 expression in human breast t - ic was accompanied by bmi-1 and abcc5 overexpression , and associated with chemotherapeutic resistance and poor survival . enforced mir-128 expression increased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to doxorubicin - induced apoptosis and dna damage . emerging evidence has demonstrated the importance of cscs in cancer initiation , cancer metastasis and drug resistance . cscs are believed to be one of the most promising targets for cure of cancer . the discovery that non - coding rnas regulate cscs widens our understanding of cscs , and may provide potential novel strategies for breast cancer therapy . deletion of chromosome 6q , including region 6q14-q16 , is frequently observed in breast cancer . the small non - coding snorna u50 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in the 6q14 - 16 region , playing a role in the development and/or progression of breast cancer . genomic deletion and transcriptional downregulation of snorna u50 was detected in breast cancer cell lines . re - expression of snorna u50 inhibited colony formation of the human breast cancer cells hs578 t and mda - mb-231 . pirnas are small non - coding rna that form rna - protein complexes through interactions with piwi proteins . pirna was initially discovered in germ line cells , and considered as germ line - specific small rnas . emerging evidence indicates that pirna expression occurs in somatic cells [ 57 , 58 ] and piwil2 expression has been identified in human breast cancer cells . high - throughput deep sequencing identified a group of small rnas matching pirna sequences in human breast cancer tissues and breast cancer cell lines . the study of these non - coding small rnas in human cancer is just starting . the identification of the expression signature of these non - coding small rnas in breast cancer subtypes , and an understanding of their functional significance to oncogene expression , tumor initiation and tumor cell metastasis may shed important new perspectives on the role of these non - coding small rnas in breast cancer . small non - coding rna - based diagnostic and therapeutic applications for human cancer are expected in the near future . although tumor - targeted delivery and local administration are still major challenges to the practical application of gene therapy for cancer , mirna - based cancer therapeutic approaches are being established and tested in animal models . synthetic mirna mimics or mirna expression vectors have been successfully applied to restore or overexpress mirna in vitro . chemically modified lna anti - sense mirna inhibitor and other approaches have been used to block mirna function in cells . kim et al . recently reported significant anti - tumor effect of virus - mediated delivery of mir-145 combined with 5-fu to treat breast cancer . intranasal delivery of let-7   and intravenous delivery of mir-34a mimics   for non - small - cell lung cancer treatment and a virus - mediated delivery of mir-26a for liver cancer treatment in mouse model   demonstrate the promise of mirna for treatment of cancer . dysregulated expression of mirnas has implicated components of the non -

Here's a summary of our research:\n\n- **Purpose:** We wanted to understand how miRNAs affect the growth of breast cancer cells.\n- **Research:** We looked at recent studies on how different miRNAs control the cell cycle, which is the process cells go through to grow and divide.\n- **Findings:** \n    * We found that some miRNAs act as \"brakes\" on cell growth, while others act as \"accelerators.\"\n    * These miRNAs control cell growth by targeting specific genes that are important for different stages of the cell cycle.\n    * For example, some miRNAs can stop cells from making proteins needed for cell division, effectively halting tumor growth.\n- **Implications:**\n    * This means that miRNAs could be potential targets for new breast cancer treatments.\n    * By developing therapies that either increase the amount of \"brake\" miRNAs or block the \"accelerator\" miRNAs, we may be able to slow down or stop tumor growth.\n    * Additionally, miRNAs found in the blood could be used as biomarkers to help diagnose breast cancer earlier. \n", "output_text_b": "This article reviews the role of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs), particularly microRNAs (miRNAs), in breast cancer development and progression. \n\nHere are the key takeaways:\n\n* **miRNAs and Breast Cancer:** miRNAs are short RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. They play a crucial role in breast cancer by acting as either tumor suppressors or promoters (oncogenes).\n* **miRNA Dysregulation:** Aberrant expression of miRNAs is frequently observed in breast cancer, contributing to uncontrolled cell growth, survival, and metastasis.\n* **Cell Cycle Control:** Specific miRNAs influence different phases of the cell cycle, impacting breast cancer cell proliferation. For example, miR-17/20 and let-7 regulate the G1-S transition, while miR-21 and miR-27a affect the G2-M checkpoint.\n* **Cancer Stem Cells:** miRNAs also regulate cancer stem cells (CSCs), a subpopulation of cells within tumors responsible for tumor initiation, metastasis, and drug resistance.\n* **Therapeutic Potential:** The ability of miRNAs to control crucial processes in breast cancer makes them promising targets for novel therapies. Strategies include restoring tumor suppressor miRNAs or inhibiting oncogenic miRNAs.\n* **Diagnostic Biomarkers:** Dysregulated miRNAs found in the bloodstream could serve as potential biomarkers for early breast cancer detection and prognosis.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding the complex roles of miRNAs in breast cancer provides valuable insights for developing innovative diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. \n", "score": -0.75, "individual_rater_scores": [{"is_flipped": false, "score": -0.5, "rating_label": "B is slightly better", "rationale": "Both responses adequately summarize the article.

( 2007 ) suggested that it was only effective in reducing the incidence of moderate ohss , but not in its severe form  ( alvarez et al . , 2007 ) . low - dose aspirin therapy and doxycycline have also been suggested to inhibit angiogenesis  ( fainaru et al . , 2009 ) . ( 2011 ) believes that the concept of an ohss - free clinic has become a reality . the authors suggest that this approach should include pituitary down - regulation using a gnrh antagonist , ovulation triggering with a gnrh agonist and vitrification of oocytes or embryos  ( devroey et al . , 2011 ) . severe and critical forms of ohss are associated with significant ascites  ( golan et al . , 1989 ; rizk et al . , ascites results in an increased abdominal pressure compromising venous return , cardiac output and renal perfusion  ( navot et al . paracentesis is frequently needed , as prompt drainage of fluid produces a significant clinical and biochemical improvement , including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process  ( rizk et al . , multiple paracenteses may be required to relieve symptoms and avoid serious sequelae of hemoconcentration , hypotension , decreased renal perfusion and severe respiratory compromise . instead of multiple interventions , the placement of a catheter temporarily for a few days will permit complete drainage through one procedure  ( rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ) . pigtail catheters have been used for drainage in various clinical situations . in a previous study we described the use of percutaneous placement of a pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites caused by severe / critical ohss  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) . in this study we established the efficacy and safety of pigtail catheter drainage in the management of severe / critical ohss in patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer at our centre between 1999 and 2001 on both inpatient and outpatient basis . the aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of the pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with early onset severe ohss . this is a retrospective study that included all patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and developed severe or critical ohss by the golan classification  ( golan et al . , 1989 ) in the period between 2004 and 2009 . all patients underwent an ultrasound evaluation which documented the presence of severe ascites and bilateral ovarian enlargement . all patients presented with shortness of breath , marked abdominal distension , nausea , weight gain and lower abdominal pain . thirteen patients complained of vomiting , and 3 patients reported decreased urine output  ( less than 720 cc per 24  hours ) and had haemoglobin   15 g / dl . all 33 patients were offered treatment using pigtail catheter insertion as an alternative to trans - vaginal paracentesis . blood studies including a complete blood count , creatinine , electrolytes , serum albumin and total protein , and coagulation panel were ordered prior to the procedure . all 33  patients were rehydrated with intravenous crystalloid solutions  ( 0.9% normal saline ) . care was taken to give the patient the same amount of fluid as the amount that was drained from the peritoneal cavity . all pigtail catheter placements were performed in the operating room at our surgical centre . the catheter  ( 6 - 0 french , 2.0 mm , boston scientific , quincy , ma , usa ) was introduced utilizing a non - disposable metal gamete intra - fallopian treatment  ( gift ) trocar and cannula  ( embryon gift catheter , ivf online , gilford , ct , usa ) which was introduced into the largest accessible ascitic fluid pocket in the upper outer quadrant of the abdominal wall under local anaesthesia and trans - abdominal ultrasound guidance . the trocar was then removed and a glide wire  ( boston scientific corp . , watertown , ma , usa ) was threaded through the gift canula . the canula was removed with care so as to keep the glide wire in the peritoneal cavity . the pigtail catheter was guided into the peritoneal cavity by the wire after removal of the stylet of the pigtail catheter . the catheter was anchored to the skin using 2 - 0 silk suture and it was supported by gauze , which was covered by a tegaderm . the catheter was connected to a three - way stop cock which was connected to a drainage bag . initial amount of drained fluid was calculated and subsequently the patients were trained to drain 1000 cc per day  ( 500 cc in the morning and 500 cc in the evening ) . one liter normal saline and 500 cc of 6% hydroxyethyle starch solution  ( hespan ) was administered to the patient on the same day of pigtail catheter placement . any patient with critical ohss according to the golan classification , or those in whom the presenting symptoms and signs did not completely subside after drainage of ascitic fluid and iv fluid replacement , were admitted to the hospital for observation and further management . all other patients were sent home . once there was minimal or no drainage from the catheter , the patient returned to the office for removal of the catheter . the patients were encouraged to drink plenty of fluids and to increase their protein intake . all patients kept a diary for body weight , abdominal girth , and urine output before and after the procedure . patients were seen in the office as needed for evaluation and hydration with normal saline . demographic data including mean age  ( years ) , duration of infertility  ( years ) , bmi  ( kg / m2 ) and aetiology of infertility are illustrated in table i. ovarian stimulation data including number of treatment days , total dose of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone , hormone serum levels , endometrial thickness , number of follicles and number of patients receiving only 5000 iu of human chorionic gonadotrophin is illustrated in table ii . our data include the number of patients requiring early versus late placement of pigtail catheter , mean amount of ascitic fluid drained immediately after pigtail placement , number of days of pigtail catheter drainage and the number of days between oocyte retrieval and the onset of severe ohss symptoms requiring pigtail placement . table iii also illustrates the number of patients who underwent coasting , number of patients who received prophylactic hespan on day of egg retrieval . values are expressed as mean + standard deviation values are expressed as mean  +  standard deviation : rfsh  =  recombinant fsh ; hmg  = human menopausal gonadotropins ; hcg  =  human chorionic gonadotropin ; e2  =  estradiol values are expressed as mean + standard deviation three patients  ( 9% ) required an early placement of a pigtail catheter while 30 patients  ( 91% ) had late placement of the catheter  ( table iii ) . twenty - nine patients  ( 88% ) were managed on an outpatient basis without any complications . four patients  ( 12% ) required hospital admission for 1 - 7 days  ( 3 + 2.7 ) , three for associated severe pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis . these three patients were admitted to the hospital immediately after insertion of the pigtail catheter for management of severe pleural effusion and careful observation . one patient was admitted 48 hours after insertion of the pigtail catheter for work up for chest pain , all tests were negative . navot et al . , 1992 ; rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ) , but perhaps the most accepted classification of ohss is the one described by golan et al as mild , moderate and severe  ( golan et al . , 1989 ) . however , clinicians should be aware that ohss is a dynamic condition and moderate ohss may progress to severe ohss within hours  ( rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ; rizk , 2009 ) . therefore , the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine  ( asrm ) proposed a classification for ohss of mild , worsening and serious  ( the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine , 2008 ) . recognizing the patients at high - risk , prevention and early recognition are the most important steps in the management of ohss  ( rizk , 2006 ) . however , severe forms of ohss , especially late onset type that occurs when patients are pregnant , most likely will continue to happen , albeit at much lower rate , unless one reverts to a total freeze of all embryos after the use of gnrh agonist as a trigger shot in a gnrh antagonist cycle  ( donoso and devroey , 2013 ; devroey et al . , 2011 ) . traditional treatment consists mainly of supportive management until spontaneous resolution occurs  ( rizk , 1994 ) . although moderate ohss does not usually require intervention , outpatient monitoring is essential to identify progression to a severe form  ( rizk , 2006 ) . patients with moderate ohss can be managed on an outpatient basis by adequate hydration and close daily monitoring of weight gain and abdominal girth to detect progression to severe ohss , and to provide intervention , if required  ( rizk , 2010 ) . patients presenting with severe forms of ohss are usually managed on inpatient basis and most patients with critical ohss are admitted to intensive care units for aggressive supportive measures to avoid maternal morbidity and mortality  ( the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine , 2008 ) . correction of hypovolemia , electrolyte imbalance and hypoalbuminemia are the basic principles during the treatment of severe ohss  ( rizk , 1994 , 2006 ; myrianthefs et al . , 2000 ) . ( 1992 ) suggested that paracentesis is the single most important treatment modality in life - threatening ohss not controlled by medical therapy . paracentesis and removal of ascites result in relieving the pressure on the inferior vena cava and improvement in venous return , cardiac output and renal perfusion  ( padilla et al . , 1990 ) . therefore , prompt drainage of fluid produces significant clinical and biochemical improvement , including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ; the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine , 2008 ) . it is also possible that removal of ascites decreases the amount of vegf and its effects on vascular permeability . therefore ultrasound guided drainage of the ascitic fluid should be performed in severe cases of ohss with respiratory distress , oliguria or severe abdominal pain  ( padilla et al . , 1990 ) . this can be done either trans - vaginally  ( aboulghar et al . , 1990 ) or trans - abdominally  ( padilla et al . , 1990 ) . however , recurrence of ascites is common in severe cases of ohss . placement of a pigtail catheter has been proposed by some investigators to allow drainage of ascitic fluid whenever it accumulates without the need for further surgical procedures  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) . in a previous study we reported the use of percutaneous pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites in severe ohss as an alternative to repeated paracentesis  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) . this procedure is relatively simple and requires a short period of time as compared to the time needed to gradually aspirate any fluid accumulation transvaginally . immediate relief of symptoms and signs of severe ohss after pigtail catheter insertion was an important finding . in addition , the ease by which any accumulated ascitic fluid was drained resulted in a faster resolution of ohss  ( abuzeid et al . , no infection was reported  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) . in that study the first 13 patients they were discharged home with the pigtail catheter in place and managed on an outpatient basis until ohss subsided ; thereafter the catheter was removed . the last 13 patients were managed on an outpatient basis without any problem  ( abuzeid mi , et al . , 2003 ) . our previous study confirmed the safety and effectiveness of the pigtail catheter for the management of severe ohss . therefore , we embarked on the current study to evaluate the role of pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with severe ohss syndrome . in the current study we demonstrated that patients who were diagnosed very early with severe ohss can be managed safely and effectively on outpatient basis using pigtail catheter drainage , iv fluid replacement and careful monitoring . although all 33 patients presented with shortness of breath , marked abdominal distension , nausea , weight gain and lower abdominal pain , and 13 of them complained of vomiting ,  ( all are criteria for hospital admission according to the practice committee of the american society for reproductive medicine on ohss ) , 30 patients were sent home as their presenting symptoms were relieved . early diagnosis and intervention resulted in rapid elimination of the symptoms of severe ohss and normalization of vital signs , which allow us to manage the patients on outpatient basis . the pigtail catheter placements were performed without complications and patients were discharged home after a few hours of observation . the patients who needed hospital admission were those with associated severe pleural effusion requiring thoracentesis . another patient was admitted to the hospital for 1 day for work up for chest pain and possible diagnosis of pulmonary embolism . once pulmonary embolism was ruled out , she was discharged home with a pigtail catheter in place and she was managed on outpatient basis . outpatient management of ohss has no place in those who fail to have complete resolutions of their symptoms , or those with severe hyperproteinuria or electrolyte imbalance . certainly it has no place in patients with critical ohss such as those with severe pleural effusion , diminished urine output , severe hemoconcentration and those at increased risk of thromboembolic risks  ( rizk , 2010 ) . it is imperative to stress that such a protocol can only be used in patients who are motivated , reliable and have the necessary support at home to allow them to return to the clinic or go to the emergency room if the need arises . it also requires dedicated in vitro fertilization nurses to educate and follow up the patient on a daily basis . contrary to other reports that state that access to intravenous albumin is a critical part of outpatient management for severe ohss , we did not use any albumin replacement  ( lincoln et al . , 2002 ) . the reason behind the use of intravenous albumin is to increase intravascular oncotic pressure , thereby curtailing the exodus of free water from the intravascular space . in our study we used hespan instead of albumin , as some investigators have shown that it is beneficial in reducing the incidence of severe ohss  ( youssef et al . , 2011 ) . by increasing the intravascular oncotic pressure in addition , the majority of our patients had late onset ohss as a result of pregnancy . hespan should be used with caution in patients with late onset ohss only when benefits outweigh risks.it is a fact that outpatient management of early severe ohss is a common practice among infertility specialists after trans - vaginal aspiration of ascitic fluid and iv fluid hydration . outpatient management by repeated abdominal or trans - vaginal paracentesis has been reported to be safe , effective and cost effective  ( lincoln et al . , 2002 ; shrivastav et al . , 1994 ; fluker et al . , 2000 ( 1994 ) were the first to suggest that day care management in patients with severe ohss with abdominal paracentesis and iv hydration was simple , safe and effective compared with traditional treatment with in - patient hospitalization and supportive measures . ( 2002 ) concluded that the need for hospitalization for hyperstimulated patients can be minimized by outpatient management of severe ohss with trans - vaginal culdocentesis and rehydration with crystalloids and albumin . ( 2000 ) advocated in a pilot study an active management strategy for moderate ohss , which involved early paracentesis designed to minimize the progression from moderate to severe ohss , instead of late paracentesis aimed at speeding up recovery in severely ill patients . ( 2010 ) concluded that early outpatient paracentesis for moderate to severe ohss is the most cost effective management plan when compared with traditional conservative inpatient therapy . ( 2009 ) reported a large series of patients with severe ohss in whom the vast majority were successfully managed as outpatients with use of aggressive trans - vaginal paracentesis  ( smith et al . , 2009 ) . despite the findings in our study it is important to emphasize that ohss remains a serious disorder with the potential for rapid deterioration , requiring hospitalization and intensive treatment of a critically ill patient . the life - threatening complications of ohss are secondary to thromboembolism or compromised pulmonary or cardiovascular function and multi - organ failure . there have been isolated reports of women dying from the complications associated with ohss . the mortality rate related to ohss is very low and was estimated by brinsden et al . more recently , reports regarding maternal mortality rates due to ohss in the netherlands and united kingdom demonstrate an incidence of approximately 3 deaths per 100,000 in ivf cycles  ( braat et al . , 2006 ; lewis , 2007 ) . eleven lethal complications of assisted reproductive technology have been documented and summarized by braat et al . several investigators reported sporadic fatality as a result of ohss due to adult respiratory distress syndrome , massive pulmonary oedema , myocardial infarction , and carotid artery occlusion resulting in cerebral infarction . in this study we describe a modified technique of what interventional radiologists usually use for pigtail catheter placement . we observed that in the obese patients the metal introducer provided in the pigtail catheter kit is difficult to use ; instead we used the non disposable gamete intra - fallopian treatment trocar and cannula to facilitate the introduction of the catheter through the abdominal wall of such patients . this technique helps to manage the patients in the office without the need for sending her to the hospital for an interventional radiologist to place the catheter . however , the patients in this study were identified from our in vitro fertilization database ; the study included every patient who developed severe / critical ohss . in addition , the lack of a control group that was managed without pigtail catheter placement limits the conclusions that can be drawn from our study . in summary , drainage of ascitic fluid in patients with severe / critical ohss is an important step in the management of this condition  ( rizk , 2010 ) . the placement of a pigtail catheter resulted in a safe and effective outpatient management of the majority of patients with severe ohss . however , outpatient management of this potentially fatal condition requires clear understanding that rapid deterioration may occur , which may necessitate hospitalization and intensive treatment of a critically ill patient  ( rizk , 2006 , 2010 ) . patients with critical ohss and those with persistence of symptoms of severe ohss despite insertion of a pigtail catheter and drainage of ascitic fluid should be admitted to the hospital for inpatient management ..

However, a significant proportion of females with classic CAH were diagnosed only in late adolescence, despite having genital ambiguity from birth, highlighting a delay in seeking medical attention.\n* **Treatment:** Treatment varied based on age and CAH subtype. Children primarily received hydrocortisone, while adults were mainly on dexamethasone. Non-classical CAH patients received anti-androgen therapy and oral contraceptives.\n* **Outcomes:** Short stature was prevalent (35%) among patients receiving therapy, with an average final adult height significantly lower than the population average. Over-replacement therapy, indicated by suppressed 17 OHP levels, was observed in one-third of patients and likely contributed to reduced final height. Obesity and hypertension were not significantly elevated in this cohort.\n\nThe study emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and appropriate management of CAH to optimize growth and prevent long-term complications. It also underscores the need for increased awareness and timely medical intervention, particularly for females with classic CAH who may experience delayed diagnosis despite early signs. \n", "score": -0.5, "individual_rater_scores": [{"is_flipped": false, "score": -0.5, "rating_label": "B is slightly better", "rationale": "Both responses provide similar summaries, but [Response B] is negligibly better as it explicitly mentions the study being in South India, which may be relevant to the user."}, {"is_flipped": true, "score": -0.5, "rating_label": "A is slightly better", "rationale": "Both responses answer the user's question by summarizing the key findings of the article.

dependent diabetes can be induced by multiple low doses of streptozotocin ( mlds ) ( 15 ) . this model is a commonly used animal model that has many histological and clinical features similar to those of human type 1 diabetes and involves the participation of macrophages and t cells . streptozotocin ( stz ) is a pancreatic  cell toxin that induces inflammation of the islets by immune cells when it is given in multiple low doses ( 16 ) . this model of diabetes offers some advantages , such as simultaneous appearance of diabetes mellitus in all animals and not having immune abnormalities that may complicate studies in spontaneous diabetes in non - obese diabetic ( nod ) mice or bio breeding ( bb ) rats . therefore , this model as a good model has been applied extensively to investigate the type 1 diabetes mellitus , especially study the immune pathways and modulations of autoimmune insulitis and  cell death ( 17 - 18 ) . c57bl/6 mice , also called  c57 black 6  or simply  black 6  has the advantage of strain stability and easy breeding . the most common application of c57bl/6 mice is to serve as physiological or pathological models for in vivo experiments ( 19 ) . as such , mlds induced c57bl/6j mice were chosen to evaluate the anti - hyperglycemic activity of ptx and investigate the immunotherapeutic molecular mechanisms of how ptx attenuated the development of t1d . ptx is commonly used for the treatment of microcirculatory disorders and yields only minimal side effects in patients . in addition , due to its varied immunomodulatory effects , ptx has been used in several autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis ( 20 ) , multiple sclerosis ( 21 ) , and systemic lupus erythematosus ( 22 ) . drugs that increase the level of camp , including pde inhibitors , are known to prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses ( 20 ) . previous studies have also shown that ptx lowers blood glucose levels in diabetic animals ( 23 ) , and the results from the present studies also indicated that ptx possessed an anti - hyperglycemic property . more importantly , the present data demonstrated that ptx could increase serum insulin concentrations in type 1 diabetic mice . it has been shown that ptx could reduce ( but not abrogate ) the insulin requirements or lengthen the  honeymoon  ( non - insulin - requiring ) period in a study of 21 children with new - onset type 1diabetes ( 24 ) . t helper 1 cells produce proinflammatory cytokines ( tnf- , ifn -  , il-1 , il-6 , and il-12 ) , which activate macrophages and cytotoxic t cells to destroy -cells , whereas anti - inflammatory cytokines ( il-4 and il-10 ) that are produced by activated t helper 2 cells , prevent -cell destructive insulitis ( 25 ) . il-10 has been shown to prevent the onset of diabetes in mice ( 26 ) . in response to cytokine stimulation , -cells generate reactive oxygen species ( ross ) and reactive nitrogen species such as nitric oxide ( no ) , which facilitate their destruction ( 27 ) . no is also synthesized within cytokine - activated macrophages by inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) ( 28 ) . more recently , the role of il-17-producing t cells have been demonstrated in the development of several autoimmune diseases , including multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes . il-17 is a proinflammatory cytokine that is detrimental to pancreatic islet cells ( 29 ) . il-17 promotes infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages , stimulates the production of other proinflammatory cytokines , including tnf- , il-1 , il-6 and il-12 , by activated macrophages and induces nitric oxide release from  cells that interferes with their function and cause -cell destruction ( 30 , 5 ) . it has been assumed that ptx similar to camp elevating agents , selectively suppresses the production of t helper type 1(il-2 , ifn -  ) , but not t helper type 2(il-4 , il-6 , il-10 ) cytokines ( 31 ) . however , it has also been demonstrated that the effect of ptx on cytokine production is cell - specific ( 32 ) . the present study shows that ptx is not only able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines ( ifn -  and il-17 ) , but can also increase the production of anti - inflammatory cytokines ( il-10 ) . since ptx has been found to be able to inhibit the release of proinflammatory cytokines ( 33 ) , and favor th2 response ( 34 ) , it may indirectly interfere with the induction of inos . it has been shown that pde inhibitors elevate camp , prevent or attenuate inflammatory cell responses ( 35 ) and suppress proliferation of lymphocytes ( 36 ) . our findings are consistent with previous studies , showing that ptx treatment prevented lymphocyte proliferation . in summary , results of the present work demonstrated that the suppressive effect of the ptx treatment on t1d was accompanied by decreased blood glucose level , increased plasma insulin level , suppression of t cell proliferation , down - regulation of th1 and th17 cytokines ( ifn -  and il-17 ) and increase in the production of il-10 in supernatant of splenic culture of the treated mice . it seems that pentoxifylline treatment has a therapeutic effect against mlds - induced diabetes in mice ..

in another study , they found a 76.1% prevalence in patients with severe refractory asthma and a 71.1% prevalence in patients with non - severe asthma . in one study , bachert et al . found a 38.1% prevalence of positivity for staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies in patients with asthma ( independently of disease severity ) and a 62% prevalence in patients with severe asthma ; in another study , they found a 59.6% prevalence in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma and a 40.8% prevalence in patients with controlled asthma , \n\n\n  the latter prevalence being closer to that found in the present study . aureus , such as sinonasal polyposis , bronchiectasis , chronic bronchitis , and atopic dermatitis , were not included in the present study . by facilitating colonization or infection with s . aureus , the aforementioned conditions can lead to increased quantities of staphylococcal toxins in the body , resulting in increased ige - mediated sensitization and , consequently , a heterogeneous population of asthma patients . the studies conducted by kowalski et al . \n\n\n  and bachert et al . \n\n\n  had no such exclusion criteria and included patients with chronic sinus disease and sinonasal polyposis , as was the case with the most recent study by kowalski et al . , \n  who nevertheless found no statistically significant differences between asthma patients with polyposis and those without regarding their levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies . this might explain the differences between our results and those obtained by the two aforementioned groups of authors regarding the degree of ige - mediated sensitization . aureus in the brazilian population ; therefore , it is currently impossible to determine whether or not it is lower than that in the european population . it is also impossible to determine whether the allergic immune response to staphylococcal toxins is lower in asthma patients in brazil than in those in other countries .   in the present study , there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding the frequency of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies . our results are qualitatively similar to but quantitatively different from those obtained by kowalski et al . , \n\n\n  who found significantly higher levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies in patients with severe asthma . in addition , our results are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those obtained by bachert et al . these differences are also due to the exclusion criteria used in the present study , which were not used in any of the aforementioned studies , and to specific characteristics of our study population , as previously mentioned .   in the present study , ige antibodies to sea , seb , sec , and tsst were found in 62 ( 43.7% ) of the 142 asthma patients analyzed , and neither the frequency of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies nor the serum levels of those antibodies were associated with the clinical severity of asthma . these results are extremely relevant because this is the first study on this topic in latin america , the results of which differed from those of previous studies conducted in europe , indicating a \" negative \" association .   the limitations of the present study lie in the fact that it was a single - center study conducted at a tertiary care university hospital , in a single demographic area of brazil . our primary objective was to evaluate the influence of serum levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies and their association with asthma severity , meaning that this was not a population prevalence study of ige sensitization in asthma patients and healthy individuals in our region . if that had been the case , a much larger sample size would have been required , and it would have been impossible to obtain that in a single - center study . therefore , in the present study , each group served as the control group for the other , without the use of a third group , comprising healthy individuals . multicenter studies in brazil and other latin american countries are needed in order to determine more accurately the role of ige - mediated sensitization to staphylococcal toxins as an aggravator of asthma , as well as to determine its prevalence in asthma patients and healthy individuals . such studies should include asthma patients with and without diseases that can lead to increased colonization or infection with s ..

threatening illness experiences and complex treatments , different technologies and different equipment are used for them . these cases could potentially lead to the dissatisfaction of their families . in the meantime , the families of trauma and neurosurgical patients are more vulnerable than the other groups of patients . they need supports that are more emotional and should be accepted by the icu staff . today , there are many theories expressed that in intensive care units , the patient and his family should be considered as a single unit . by providing care to this unit , the aim of this study was to analyze the satisfaction of the families of icu patients . the tool of society of critical care medicine s family needs assessment ( sccmfna ) ( which has been validated in 1998 by johnson ) was used in that study . the results showed that most of the family satisfaction was related to the communication and patient care and the lowest level of satisfaction was about the ability of staff to patients family comfort . bailey et al . have conducted a study in 2009 with the purpose of investigating the relationship between informational support to families of special care patients and their anxiety and satisfaction . they showed that there is a direct link between the informational support and their satisfaction . the study of fumis et al . in 2008 also showed that the increase in the availability of physicians for giving the information to the patient s family and as well as nurses efforts to provide understandable explanations about the patient s condition to them will increase the patient s family satisfaction . this clinical trial was performed with respect to the existing gap for a study carried out for investigating the interventions for the satisfaction of the patients in the special care units and their families in iran . the purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital in 2010 . the statistical research community was the families of hospitalized patients in neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra ( sa ) hospital , isfahan , iran from may to september 2010 . with respect to inclusion criteria , the families of 64 patients were selected with simple sampling . after obtaining the informed consents from the hospitalized patients , by using the envelopes , which were prepaid by using a table of random numbers , they were divided into two groups ( intervention and control ) . the inclusion criteria was included as the following cases : to be a first - degree member of the family , to be older than 18 years , willing to participate in the study , having the power to speak and write in farsi , to be hospitalized one day before the study , lack of physical or mental problem in the family member , no responsibility for the care of another patient , introduced as the first person responsible for the patient care . obtaining the written informed consent , completion of the questionnaires about demographic information and the families satisfaction were performed in the second day of hospitalization of the patients in icu in both groups . johnson questionnaire for the satisfaction of the family of icu patients was used to measure the family satisfaction . the rating of the questionnaire was performed by using the likert scale with four options of 0 to 4 as follows : almost all the time ( 3 scores ) , often ( 2 scores ) , only occasionally ( 1 score ) and never ( zero score ) . johnson s questionnaire was the modified type of multer patient s family needs , which was evaluated in various scientific researches and there are extensive evidences for its validity . the interventions were performed in the second and the third day of hospitalization of the patient in the neurosurgery icu by the researcher in the morning shift for the intervention group . thus , the researcher provided understandable explanations about the disease to the patient s family and answered honestly to the questions about the patient and the disease . the researcher ensured them for providing the best care in the section and spoke about the prognosis of the disease . the researcher took the family member to the patient s room and gave the necessary information about the room space , equipment , personnel departments and the actions that were done for the patient . the patient family member was contacted if there was a change in the patient condition . they let the family help the patient in some cases of the public health ( such as hand and foot massage and giving food ) . locations of rest , nutrition , prayer room , bathroom and buffet of the hospital were introduced to them . the telephone numbers of hospitals and wards ( and if necessary , the social worker and supervisor ) were given . various departments and personnel of the hospital were taught to accept the families and communicate with them . the hospital social worker was introduced and if necessary , the patient s family was allowed to express their feelings . these interventions were performed in the evening shift of the second and the third day of the patient reception . the actions were carried out by the fellow researcher . while , for the control group , only the routine work was done . on the fourth day , the satisfaction survey was completed by the selected family member in both of the intervention and control groups . statistical methods used in this study were 2 test , man - whitney , independent student s t - test and paired t - tests . the findings did not show statistically significant difference in the demographic characteristics of the intervention and control groups , such as : age ( p < 0.99 ) , gender ( p < 0.79 ) , marital status ( p < 0.41 ) , educational level ( p < 0.12 ) and relation with patient ( p < 0.54 ) . as shown in table 1 , there was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score before the intervention in the intervention and control groups ( p > 0.05 ) . the mean satisfaction score after the intervention in the intervention group was significantly more than the control group ( p < 0.001 ) . the mean satisfaction score in the intervention group after the intervention was significantly higher than before the intervention ( p < 0.001 ) . there was no significant difference in the mean satisfaction score in the control group before and after the intervention ( p > 0.05 ) ( table 2 ) . comparison of mean satisfaction score ( 100 * ) of participants in the intervention and control groups the mean of satisfaction score changes of the studied subjects in the intervention and control groups after intervention the results of the present study showed that the nursing interventions based on the family needs increased the patient s family satisfaction in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al - zahra hospital . due to the differences in the study design , study population , the number of samples and methods of intervention , it would be difficult to compare the results . in chien et al . study , the results showed that performing the training based on the patients family needs in the icu , decreased the anxiety and increased their satisfaction . in the study of myhren et al . indicated that effective communication of the staff with the families of icu patients would increase their satisfaction . in the study by rosher and robinson , it showed that involving the families in patient care led to increase their satisfaction than before the intervention . the mentioned results were consistent with the results of this study , because all of these interventions were some parts of the interventions performed in this study . however , the study of steele et al . indicated that clinical training had no impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in the icu . therefore , there was no statistically significant difference in the satisfaction level in the control and intervention group . in this study , it was shown that the use of nursing interventions based on family needs ( confidence , support , information , proximity and convenience ) had significant impact on the family satisfaction of the patient hospitalized in intensive care unit . they should be based on the family investigation and recognition and their priority needs should be determined in order to cause the greatest satisfaction . the icu nurses must also accept their role in the care of patient s family members . the findings of this study could be a basis for performing further studies about family needs of the patients in the icu especially with the different forms of culture and economy . consequently , the increase in family satisfaction of patients can reduce the stress disorders and improve their mental state and ultimately better support of the patient by the family . this study only examined the effect of nursing interventions in the first days of hospitalization on the satisfaction of the families but the effects on the patient s entire hospitalization period has not been assessed . by performing other researches in this field , it would be possible to compare the differences in the effects of nursing interventions based on the needs of families in the early days and the whole period of the patient s hospitalization ..

Half of these families received usual care. The other half received special attention from nurses who:\n\n* Explained the patient's condition clearly.\n* Showed them around the ICU and explained equipment.\n* Kept them updated about their loved one's progress.\n* Helped them feel involved in the patient's care.\n* Provided information about hospital resources.\n\n**Findings:** Families who received the special attention from nurses reported feeling much more satisfied than those who received usual care. \n\n**Implications:** This means that when nurses make an effort to support and involve families, it can make a big difference in how those families cope with the stress of having a loved one in the ICU. This can lead to a better experience for everyone involved. \n", "output_text_b": "This article explores the impact of nursing interventions on the satisfaction of families with loved ones in the Neurosurgery Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The study, conducted at Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran, highlights the significant stress experienced by families due to a patient's critical condition and the unfamiliar ICU environment. \n\nThe research emphasizes the importance of addressing the five key needs of families: assurance, proximity to the patient, information, comfort, and support. These needs are often unmet, leading to dissatisfaction. The study implemented nursing interventions focused on these needs, including clear communication about the patient's condition, emotional support, and guidance on hospital resources. \n\nThe results demonstrated that these interventions significantly increased family satisfaction compared to the control group. This finding aligns with previous studies emphasizing the positive impact of communication, information sharing, and family involvement in patient care on satisfaction levels. \n\nThe study concludes that addressing family needs is crucial for improving their satisfaction and reducing stress. It recommends further research on the long-term effects of such interventions and their applicability across diverse cultural and economic backgrounds. Ultimately, the study advocates for recognizing the patient and their family as a single unit, prioritizing their needs to ensure optimal care and well-being. \n", "score": -0.25, "individual_rater_scores": [{"is_flipped": false, "score": 0.5, "rating_label": "A is slightly better", "rationale": "Both responses give good summaries of the article's key findings on family satisfaction and ICU care.

5 ] . nowadays , cardiovascular diseases are among the most widespread chronic diseases in most countries . according to forecasts , the mortality rate in eastern mediterranean countries including iran will be 30 - 35% [ 6 , 7 ] . despite the emphasis on prevention and development of newtreatments , surgery is the only choice for many patients with cardiovascular disease . one of the surgical procedures for the treatment of cardiovascular patients is coronary artery bypass surgery . in fact , heart surgery significantly influences on the quality of life of patients with cardiovascular diseases . hence , heart surgery is an important event in the lives of patients causing collapse of economic , professional and personal life . on the other hand , each surgical procedure is associated with several psychological complications for patients . of the most important complications are anxiety and depression so that approximately 65% of cardiovascular patients experience them after surgical and medical interventions . in fact , anxiety and depression complicate the treatment process [ 7 , 8 ] . some scientists believe that anxiety is one of the essential elements of human life . however , acute and long - term anxiety is integral part of all psychological diseases . according to nemati and colleagues , in fact , anxiety is a common psychological response of cardiovascular patients which is associated with reduced quality of life and psychological morbidity [ 11 , 12 ] . on the other hand , anxiety causes increased heart rate and breathing as well as high blood pressure and even mortality . it is associated with increased risk of mortality , disability , increased medical care and functional impairment in daily activities [ 12 , 13 ] . clinical depression has been reported in 54% of patients after bypass surgery . according to world health organization ( who ) , depression is the fourth chronic disease where its disability is comparable with 8 major chronic disorders . the outcome of depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is deterioration of physical and emotional state . given the incidence of such complications in patients with cardiovascular disease the best practice in this area is appropriate communication with patient [ 13 , 15 ] . good and effective communication is very valuable from the perspective of patients . in general , communication is a set of learning skills . in fact , poor communication is the cause of most problems in treatment of patients . in fact , communication at the bedside is a therapeutic and professional communication . in health professionals , communication and communication skills play a very important role in satisfaction of patients and solving their problems . this is more important , especially in patients with chronic diseases or those requiring long - term care . the therapeutic communication is formed from the first encounter of the patient with the medical team [ 21 , 22 ] . however , studies have shown that the communication between patient and medical team is not efficient . the health personnel don not have adequate communication skills . in fact , nursing and medical team spend very little time to communicate with patients . accordingly , patients are not often satisfied with received information as well as the level and method of communication . hence , to achieve best therapeutic results , special attention should be paid to communication [ 16 , 19 , 22 ] . since nursing is a practical discipline based on professional knowledge , it is necessary to use knowledge infrastructure to develop new approaches in clinical practice . theories proposed by nursing scientists can be useful in this area [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . for this purpose the nurse - patient communication is an essential element of this theory [ 21 , 24 ] . according to peplau theory , the purpose of nursing care is to achieve a common good nurse - patient communication . according to peplau , peplau refers to the importance of therapeutic communication with patients and its important role in reducing anxiety [ 21 , 23 , 24 ] . in fact , this theory provides a framework for nurse - patient communication . following this framework , the nurse will be able to respond communication needs of patients through establishing a good therapeutic communication with the patient [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . hospitalization and a complex surgery such as heart surgery is a stressful process leading to depression in patients . furthermore , the need for security and psychological comfort is one of the basic needs of patients achieved through a proper structured therapeutic communication with low cost . accordingly , the objective of the present study is to examine the impact of peplau therapeutic communication model on anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary bypass surgery . this is a clinical trial with pre / post testing scheme examined the impact of independent variable ( peplau therapeutic communication ) on the dependent variables ( anxiety and depression ) . the population consisted of all patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass referred to the research environment on non - emergency basis . the research environment was al - zahra heart hospital in shiraz due to the easy access to subjects and sufficient number of patients . data were collected using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( kanter et al . ) . the reliability and validity of the scale have been studied by montazeri et al in 2003 . an internal consistency of 78% and 86% was respectively calculated for anxiety and depression using cronbach 's alpha . there are 14 four - option questions , each with a score of zero to 3 . odd and even questions are used to measure anxiety and depression , respectively ( seven questions to assess anxiety and seven questions to assess depression ) . a score of zero to 21 is given to each patient based on responses in each area ( a score of zero - seven : normal , eight-10 : moderate and > 10 : disease ) . due to the lack of access to error rate to calculate the sample size , 10 patients were selected as pilot ( with a depression and anxiety score of 10 or more based on the hospital anxiety and depression scale ) . after performing tests , the subjects were randomly divided into test and control groups ( using a coin ( toss ) ) . z12+z12s12+s22x1x22 the inclusion criteria were : being in a bypass list , having moderate to severe depression and anxiety scores , no history of mental illness , interesting in participating in the study ( i.e. the tendency of the patient and his family to participate in the intervention ) , lack of previous bypass surgery , aged between 35 and 70 years , ability to communicate verbally and ability to speak persian . the exclusion criteria included : lack of cooperation of patients and families during the intervention , failure to perform coronary artery bypass surgery for various reasons , mortality during the study , failure to attend therapeutic communication sessions ( at least the absence in two sessions ) . therapeutic communication sessions were held for the intervention group based on peplau 's model at four stages including : orientation , identification , exploitation and resolution . in total , seven sessions were held individually with the consent of the patient and his family at the hospital and patient 's home . it should be notedthat during therapeutic communication , duration of each session was variable given the location and patient 's needs . the place of each meeting was determined with the consent of the patient . at all meetings , the researcher used verbal and nonverbal communication skills to communicate with patients . to ensure the correct application of therapeutic communication skills , a self - control researcher - made tool approved by experts was used . the depression and anxiety of patients in both groups were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) at baseline and then two and four months after surgery . the obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as covariance analysis with the help of spss 16 . this study was approved by the ethics committee of the jondi shapoor medical university of ahvaz with rec.1392.58 code . the ethical issues considered in this study include an adequate explanation for the patients and their permission to participate in the study , the lack of any compulsion for patients to participate in the study , refusing to disclose secrets or private matters of patients and confidentiality of information , announcing the results without names and personal details . furthermore , the present study was registered with the irct2013072214110n1 code in clinical trial center ( irct.ir ) . this study was approved by the ethics committee of the jondi shapoor medical university of ahvaz with rec.1392.58 code . the ethical issues considered in this study include an adequate explanation for the patients and their permission to participate in the study , the lack of any compulsion for patients to participate in the study , refusing to disclose secrets or private matters of patients and confidentiality of information , announcing the results without names and personal details . furthermore , the present study was registered with the irct2013072214110n1 code in clinical trial center ( irct.ir ) . the percentage of male and female patients in the intervention group was 70.3% and 29.7% , respectively . the percentage of males and females in the control group was 51.4% and 48.6% , respectively . the status of the underlying disease was depicted in both intervention and control groups . according to results , the majority of patients were suffering from high blood pressure in both groups with a high frequency of 35.1% ( table 1 ) . as shown in table 2 , anxiety was reduced in the intervention group , while postoperative anxiety in the control group was increased . the hospital anxiety in the intervention group this indicates the role of peplau 's therapeutic communication in reducing hospital anxiety of patients . analysis of covariance was used to determine the effect of peplau 's therapeutic communication on anxiety level of the subjects . since hospital anxiety scale was used to measure anxiety , analysis of variance was performed using hospital anxiety scores . the results showed significant differences between experimental and control groups in terms of anxiety level immediately after surgery , two and four months after surgery after adjustment for post - test scores by eliminating the effect of pre - test . adjusted mean anxiety scores suggest that anxiety in the intervention group was lower than the control group . in fact , the mean anxiety scores of patients in the intervention group in pre - test and post - test stages represent the independent role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing anxiety in the intervention group ( f=174.02 , p=0.000 ) . moreover , the anxiety level in the intervention group two and four months after the intervention was decreased compared to the control group ( f=38.37 , p=0.000 ; f=11.58 , p=0.000 ) ( table 3 ) . as shown in table 4 , the mean depression in the intervention group was reduced after the surgery . the mean postoperative depression in the control group was increased . in fact , the hospital depression in the intervention group was reduced after the therapeutic communication . this indicates that the role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing hospital depression . analysis of covariance was used to determine the effect of peplau 's therapeutic communication on depression level of the subjects . since hospital depression scale was used to measure depression , analysis of variance was performed using hospital depression scores . the results showed significant differences between experimental and control groups in terms of depression level immediately after surgery , two and four months after surgery after adjustment for post - test scores by eliminating the effect of pre - test . adjusted mean depression scores suggest that anxiety in the intervention group was lower than the control group . in fact , the mean depression scores of patients in the intervention group in pre - test and post - test indicate the independent role of peplau 's therapeutic communication model in reducing depression in the intervention group ( f=163.27 , p=0.000 ) . such a difference is not observed in the control group . moreover , the depression level in the intervention group four months after the intervention was decreased compared to the control group ( f=20.58 , p=0.000 ) . however , no significant difference was found between two groups in terms of hospital depression two months after intervention ( p=0.61 ) ( table 5 ) . according to the results , peplau 's therapeutic communication is effective in reducing anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary artery bypass . it resulted in a dramatic decrease in anxiety and depression scores in the intervention group . depression and anxiety are the most important preventive factors in cardiovascular diseases   causing disease rejection by the patient and reduce the incentive to treat and increase the likelihood of disease recurrence [ 25 - 27 ] . most patients with coronary heart disease who survive after surgery resume their normal life after several weeks or several months . previous studies show that patients suffer from anxiety and depression several months and sometimes several years after the surgery [ 26 , 27 , 29 ] . therefore , follow - up and strategies to deal with postoperative psychological complications are of utmost importance . it is not possible except through establishing a coherent and targeted therapeutic communication . indeed , effective communication enables the medical team to identify patients needs and take steps to solve problems and meet their needs . according to dadashi , hosseini and moghaddam ( 2009 ) , staff had close encounters with patients in 85.5% of cases . according to mastaneh and mouseli ( 2013 ) , the rate of respecting patient rights in terms of communication was 60% indicating a moderate level of communication skills . on the other hand , duration and how to communicate with patients , particularly in dealing with patients with chronic diseases are essential in the hope and positive attitude to treatment and follow - up after discharge [ 29 - 31 ] . in fact , the patient gains motivation to cope with illness and trust in nurses through proper therapeutic communication , because the care of patients with either physical or mental illness requires correct and consistent communication [ 30 , 31 ] . therefore , implementing a communication pattern will help medical team to establish a proper communication . peplau 's model is one of these communication patterns . to communicate with patients , especially patients with chronic diseases , peplau 's described four stages and defined roles for the nurse at every step as someone who is in close relationship with the patient [ 16 , 23 ] . peplau 's communication model helps nurses and patient to identify the disease , concerns and questions of the patient . through defining different roles for the nurse this model refers to nursing skills and abilities to establish a simple convenient therapeutic communication . the model enables nurses help the patient after discharge and to spend more time with patient [ 16 , 23 , 24 ] . for example , it has been used in communicating with cancer patients and solving systematic problems of families [ 32 , 33 ] . in this study , peplau 's communication models were employed as communication sessions for patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass through applying nursing roles . the results showed that holding communication meetings with patients immediately after surgery dramatically reduced hospital anxiety and depression . accordingly , to improve the nurse - patient communication and establish more effective therapeutic communication processes which improves clinical basis and can have a positive impact on the treatment and discharge processes and rehabilitation of patients , especially in patients with chronic diseases , training courses should be included in in - service courses to train and introduce medical team with simple and inexpensive communication skills . furthermore , there is evidence that workshops on communication skills for health team can improve health outcomes and satisfaction of patients . another limitation of this study is the lower percentage of females ( 29.7% ) in the intervention group with respect to the control group ( 51.4% ) . the lower anxiety score in the intervention group could be due to therapeutic communication but also to gender differences . to write this article not contributed any financial resources and costs are the responsibility of the authors . all rights of this article reserved is owned by the ahvaz jundishapur university of medical sciences ..

binding sites , i.e. , the s189n change within antibody - binding site b ( 4,5 ) and the v226i and s227p changes residing in antibody - binding site d ( 4,5 ) . because of rotational restrictions , a proline substitution at position 227 ( s227p ) would typically give rise to considerable conformation change ; however , this particular substitution is located within a  barrel motif and therefore has little effect on regional protein conformation . cumulatively , field isolates characterized subsequent to this outbreak continue to exhibit these 4 changes , and they appear to constitute a distinct branch in the phylogeny of ha sequences when compared with h3n2 isolates from the 20032004 season . . this change may affect protein - protein interactions since it is immediately adjacent to antibody - binding site a , where neutralizing antibodies have been shown to bind ( 4,5 ) . furthermore , since the k145n substitution is located within a glycosylation site , the charge alteration may affect glycosyl transferase activity , which results in altered glycosylation . differences in glycosylation have been shown to contribute to antigenic variation by preventing antibody binding to antigenic sites ( 15 ) . additionally , 3-dimensional analysis suggests this amino acid substitution may also promote enhanced receptor binding since the asparagine r group is shorter , which may make binding requirements less stringent and the receptor cleft more accessible . the 3-dimensional depiction provides a unique regional residue perspective , demonstrating how the rapidly evolving ha surface antigens in the vaccine strain differ at the molecular level . collectively , the clinical isolates obtained from this outbreak in nepal can not be considered antigenically distinct from the a / wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain because only 4 of 9 isolates evaluated exhibited 4-fold lower titers by hi ( table 1 ) . furthermore , the varying reactivity noted in several isolates from this outbreak having identical ha1 sequences is suggestive that other viral antigens aside from the ha1 protein may have contributed to the antigenic variability observed in the hi panel . with the exception of a / nepal/1670/2004 and a / nepal/1672/2004 , all isolates evaluated by hi ( table 1 ) exhibited identical ha1 amino acid sequences and varying antigenicity profiles to a / wyoming/03/2003 reference antisera . one explanation for this observation is that genetic differences in other influenza surface proteins contribute to the observed immunoreactivity . alternative viral surface protein candidates include the neuraminidase , ha2 , and m2 glycoproteins , which have been shown to exhibit antigenic properties ( 1619 ) . in this report , we describe the genetic analysis of the ha proteins from viruses obtained from an early season outbreak and compare them to current vaccine strains . three amino acids changes ( s189n , i226v , and s227p ) were noted in known ( 4,5 ) antibody - binding sites ( table 2 ) . the fourth change ( k145n ) , which was located within a glycosylation site , may enhance viral binding since the smaller asparagine r group is located close to the ha receptor - binding cleft ( figure 3 ) . phylogenetic analyses show that the nepal isolates make up a distinct branch in the evolution of h3n2 viruses when they are compared with vaccine and reference strains ( figure 2 ) . however , antigenic data appear more ambiguous , suggesting a multigenic effect that can not solely be attributed to properties of the influenza ha ( table 1 ) . studies are in progress to characterize the neuraminidase , m2 , and ha2 proteins to determine the molecular basis responsible for antigenicity differences observed within isolates from this outbreak . the k145n substitution change has become a marker for an increasingly large subset of the fujian - like viruses . cdc and the us department of defense have recently characterized viruses with the k145n change in singapore , taiwan , china , australia , canada , and the united states . in february 2005 , who reported the emergence of a new influenza h3n2 strain in the united states . the a / california/7/2004 strain , which was first identified in the united states in september 2004 , contains all 4 changes observed in isolates from this nepalese outbreak . the a / california/7/2004 strain differs by only 1 amino acid in ha1 ( which is of no immunologic importance ) from most isolates from the outbreak in nepal . all viruses characterized ( 150 globally isolated strains ) subsequent to the preparation of this report ( march 2005 ) by the us department of defense are genetically similar in amino acid sequence to these nepalese strains ( and the a / california strain ) . most of the isolates ( 80% ) analyzed by cdc since october 2004 are antigenically related to a / california ( 20 ) , which indicates that this strain has emerged as the dominant influenza a h3n2 strain . these data indicate that these viruses may persist as the dominant strain at the onset of the 20052006 influenza season . in february 2005 , who recommended inclusion of an a / california/7/2004-like strain in the 20052006 trivalent influenza vaccine to afford immunologic protection from this variant h3n2 virus . our findings emphasize the importance of continued molecular surveillance for characterizing emerging influenza drift variants ..

We also looked at how similar this virus was to the flu viruses used to make that year's flu vaccine.\n* **Findings:** We found that the flu strain in Nepal was different from the flu strain included in the 2004-2005 vaccine. However, this new strain was very similar to the flu strain chosen for the *next* year's vaccine (2005-2006).\n* **Implications:** This means that the flu vaccine is constantly being updated to keep up with changes in the flu virus. Getting your flu shot every year is the best way to protect yourself from getting sick. \n", "output_text_b": "An influenza outbreak occurred in three Bhutanese refugee camps in Nepal in early July 2004.  The outbreak strain was characterized as influenza A (H3N2) and showed genetic drift from the previous vaccine strains.  \n\nThe study found four key amino acid changes in the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of the Nepal isolates compared to previous strains, with the K145N substitution emerging as a potential genetic marker for this new lineage. These changes, particularly K145N, were found to potentially enhance viral binding and affect antigenicity.\n\nWhile the Nepal isolates were not drastically different from the A/Wyoming/3/03 vaccine strain, the study highlights the importance of continuous molecular surveillance to track emerging influenza variants and inform vaccine development. The findings contributed to the WHO's recommendation to include an A/California/7/2004-like strain, which shares similar genetic characteristics with the Nepal isolates, in the 2005-2006 influenza vaccine. \n", "score": -0.25, "individual_rater_scores": [{"is_flipped": false, "score": 0.5, "rating_label": "A is slightly better", "rationale": "Both responses summarize the article and address the question.

western countries indicate important differences in the causes and consequences of obesity . a comparison of the association of disease with overweight and obesity in japan and the us indicated that the associations were stronger in the us than in japanese women and that there was no association in japanese men . links between social , demographic , and behavioral risk factors for obesity also differ markedly in japan , korea , and the us . the availability of biomarker data from taiwan  a middle - income country undergoing rapid economic growth , increasing obesity , and with life expectancy recently increasing to levels similar to that of the us and england  allows for investigation of the biological risk associated with obesity in a population characterized by very different cultural , behavioral , socioeconomic , and dietary parameters . we examine how elevated weight and obesity ( using an indicator that considers both bmi and waist circumference ) relate to having levels defined as clinical risk for cardiovascular , metabolic , and inflammatory markers in three aging societies that are now relatively similar in life expectancy but that differ in the timing of the epidemiological transition and obesity epidemic , history of economic development , socioeconomic levels , general lifestyle habits , health behaviors , and health care systems : the us , england , and taiwan . finding differences in the relationship between obesity and indicators of physiological dysregulation in these three aging societies will clarify whether increases in weight gain are equally problematic across all countries . we use data from three nationally representative samples : the us national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes , 20032006 ; n = 3855 ) , the english longitudinal study of ageing ( elsa , 2004 - 2005 ; n = 9139 ) , and the social environment and biomarkers of aging study ( sebas ) in taiwan ( 2000 ; n = 1023 ) . these surveys collect information on demographics , as well as anthropometric , physical , and biological measures . every year , approximately 5,000 individuals undergo detailed interviews and medical examinations , which include collection of several physiological measures . nhanes utilizes a complex sampling design , and when weights are applied , the sample is representative of the noninstitutionalized american population . we use the 20032006 data since nhanes data is released in two - year intervals , and this sample is centered on 2004 - 2005 , which matches the period in which elsa was collected . for nhanes , we use individual - level data based on a sample of 1,513 fasting individuals aged 54 and older . elsa includes participants drawn from households responding to the health survey for england ( hse ) in 1998 , 1999 , and 2001   and is representative of the english population aged 50 and older . the core elsa sample ( wave 1 : 2002 - 2003 ) includes people living in an hse responding household who were born prior to march 1 , 1952 , and their partners who could be under age 50 . wave 4 of elsa ( 2008 - 2009 ) , which includes a nurse visit , includes wave 1 core members , if they are still alive and do not refuse further contact after the first interview at wave 1 . it also includes a refresher sample to maintain the age structure of the sample ( in waves 3 and 4 ) , and their partners . for elsa , we use individual - level data based on a sample of 7,384 individuals aged 54 and older . sebas is drawn from a follow - up survey of the survey of health and living status of the near elderly and elderly in taiwan ( also known as the taiwan longitudinal study of aging ( tlsa ) ) , a nationally representative survey of taiwanese adults ( including institutionalized individuals ) collected in 1989 , 1993 , 1996 , 1999 , and 2000 . in 2000 , a subsample of individuals was randomly selected for inclusion in sebas . sebas consists of adults aged 54 and older in 2000 , with in - home interviews and medical exams taken in a hospital . for sebas , the sample averages 66.8 years of age in england , and the us and taiwan mean age is about the same ( table 1 ) . there are more men in taiwan ( 56% ) and england ( 53% ) and fewer in the us ( 44% ) . we examine the following indicators of physiological dysregulation often associated with obesity and also associated with increased risk for multiple adverse health outcomes and obesity [ 43 , 44 ] : ( 1 ) cardiovascular markers : high systolic ( sbp ) and diastolic blood pressure ( dbp ) ; ( 2 ) metabolic markers : high levels of blood lipids ( total and low - density lipoprotein ( ldl ) cholesterol , and fasting triglycerides ) , low levels of high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol , and high fasting glucose and glycated hemoglobin ; ( 3 ) high levels of inflammatory markers c - reactive protein ( crp ; available in nhanes and elsa ) and interleukin-6 ( il-6 ; available in sebas ) , as crp and il-6 have been positively associated with bmi . for each indicator we use clinical cutpoints or widely used research - based cutpoints to indicate high levels of risk which are shown in table 1 [ 39 , 43 , 45 ] . there has been debate as to the best indicator of obesity : body mass index ( bmi ) or waist circumference . waist circumference is thought to be a better measure of abdominal adiposity than bmi and a better indicator of risk of poor health outcomes , including all - cause and cardiovascular mortality [ 46 , 47 ] . for this reason we investigate the association between bmi and biomarkers across categories of bmi ( underweight < 18.5  kg / m , normal and overweight 18.529.9  kg / m , obese 3034.9  kg / m , and very obese 35  kg / m ) and waist circumference categorized as normal or high waist ( high waist : men 120  cm , women 88  cm ) . we create a composite measure of obesity and adiposity by categorizing individuals into five groups : ( 1 ) underweight and normal waist ( all underweight individuals had a normal waist circumference ) , ( 2 ) normal / overweight bmi ( termed normal bmi ) and normal waist circumference ( reference group ) , ( 3 ) normal / overweight bmi ( termed normal bmi ) and high waist circumference ( termed high waist ) , ( 4 ) obese and high waist ( all obese individuals had a high waist circumference ) , and ( 5 ) very obese . we also evaluate an alternate definition for obesity in taiwan based on bmi 27 , as it has been suggested by some that obesity levels should be differentially defined for asians [ 48 , 49 ] . a similar composite measure of obesity and adiposity was calculated using this alternate definition of bmi in taiwan . because these risk factors are all assumed to be associated with obesity and because dysregulation in multiple physiological systems has been shown to predict many of the poor health risk outcomes associated with aging , we also create two summary measures of risk based on the total number of at - risk levels of biomarkers , either 9 or 8 . because crp values for sebas are not available , this measure is not included in the 9-item summary measure for taiwan , but a summary measure ( range 09 ) was calculated for taiwan using il-6 , another indicator of inflammation , instead of the crp values included for the us and england . a second alternate summary measure of biological risk , excluding the inflammatory marker ( range 08 ) , biological risk summary scores were computed for individuals who had missing values on no more than 3 biological markers . we examine multiple covariates in our investigation of the relationship between obesity and biological risk . self - reported use of antihypertensives was determined in all three countries , and use of lipid - lowering statins was only asked in the us sample . dichotomous variables were created to indicate whether the respondent reported being a current smoker and participating in at least moderate physical activity for exercise ( e.g. , brisk walking , running , or swimming ) in the past 30 days ( for the us and england ) or generally exercising once a week ( for taiwan ) . we use logistic regression models to determine the odds of having at - risk levels of a specific biomarker for obese men and women among the three populations . for all countries , the comparison group for bmi and waist circumference is the normal bmi and normal waist group . the regressions included indicators of age , use of antihypertensives , current smoking status , and having exercised in the past 30 days . ordinary least squares ( ols ) regression models were used to determine the relationship between the summary measures of biological risk and the composite measure of obesity and adiposity . we begin by examining national differences in the high risk levels of individual biomarkers ( table 1 ) . low levels  or high risk levels  of hdl cholesterol are also more common in taiwan . high total and ldl cholesterol is more common among the english ; lower levels of plasma glucose , crp , and glycated hemoglobin are also characteristic of the english . few adults in england have elevated levels of fasting glucose ( 2.2% ) , while this is observed in 17.3% and 13.2% of american and taiwanese adults . most people in this age range are in the normal to overweight category ( 64.7% , 67.2% , and 89.4% in the us , england , and taiwan , respectively ) ( table 2(a ) ) . americans are more likely to be obese ( 33.7% ) compared to the english ( 32.1% ) and taiwanese ( 7.2% ) . among the obese , americans are much more likely to be very obese : 13.4% of the total us sample , 10.1% in england , and about 1% in taiwan . both among the obese and very obese , the average bmi is higher in the us and england compared to taiwan . few are underweight in any country ( 1.7% , 0.8% , and 3.4% in the us , england , and taiwan , resp . ) . when we examine waist circumference , the us has the highest average waist circumference , with 65.5% of americans , 55.9% of english , and 15.8% of taiwanese having a high waist size ( table 2(a ) ) . this means that high waist characterizes a substantial number of those who would be categorized as normal weight in the us and england . among those in the normal and overweight group about half ( 49.5% ) of americans and a third ( 36.4% ) of the english almost all obese individuals have a high waist in the us and england ( 98.3% in the us and 96.5% in england ) , but only 78.4% of the obese in taiwan also have a high waist . when we use the alternate obese cutpoint of 27  kg / m in taiwan , less than half of the obese individuals have a high waist ( not shown here ) . americans exhibit the highest proportion of the older population taking antihypertensive medication ( 47.1% ) ( table 1 ) . the percentage who reports taking antihypertensives is lower in england ( 32.0% ) and taiwan ( 28.6% ) . americans are more likely to be current smokers ( 24.5% ) than persons in taiwan ( 22.5% ) and england ( 13.9% ) . more than half of the population in all countries report having exercised in the past 30 days , with more english exercising ( 82.2% ) compared to taiwan ( 61.4% ) and the us ( 58.5% ) . men with normal bmi and high waist have a greater likelihood than men with normal bmi and normal waist size of having high - risk levels of triglycerides in all three countries . in the us and england , men with high waist are more likely to have high levels of glycosylated hemoglobin and higher crp ; fasting glucose is also elevated among this group in the us ( table 3(a ) ) . men who are obese in the us have fewer elevated risk factors than those with high waist who are not obese ; in the us , obese men are only more likely than normal weight men without high waist to have elevated glycated hemoglobin , fasting glucose and crp . english men who are obese have more elevated risk : both blood pressure indicators , hdl cholesterol , triglycerides , glycated hemoglobin , and crp . very obese men in england have the same elevated risk factors with the exception of dbp . very obese men in the us are more likely to have elevated fasting glucose in addition to crp and glycated hemoglobin . english and taiwanese women with normal weight and high waist are more likely to have elevated sbp , dbp , and glycosylated hemoglobin ; only british women with higher waist have significantly elevated triglycerides and only the taiwanese women had more hdl risk . high risk crp is more common among both american and english women with normal bmi and high waist , and this risk of elevated crp is also higher in the obese and very obese ( table 3(b ) ) . obese women in britain had elevations in the same markers as normal bmi and high waist english women , while obese women in the us only have elevated fasting glucose , glycated hemoglobin , and crp ; obese women in taiwan only had high dbp . with the exception of taiwan , levels of the inflammatory markers ( crp in the us and england ; il-6 in taiwan ) are more likely to be elevated among persons with a high waist and normal bmi , obese or very obese , compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts . among men , an increase in the biological risk summary score ( range 09 ) is associated with having a high waist relative to being of normal bmi and normal waist in all three countries ( table 4(a ) ) . being obese or very obese is also related to a higher biological risk summary score ( 09 ) for men in the us and england . these equations explain 6 to 11 percent of the variance in the summary indicator of biological risk . these relationships are similar for women ( table 4(b ) ) , with one exception : obese taiwanese women do not have a significantly increased biological risk compared to their normal weight and normal waist counterparts . when we consider the alternate summary score that excludes our indicators of inflammation ( range 08 ) , being obese or very obese is no longer associated with a higher biological risk summary score in us men compared to men with a normal bmi and normal waist when controls for health behaviors and medication use are included ( table 5(a ) ) . the size of the effects of the obesity categories is reduced on the 8-indicator summary measure in both england and the us , indicating the strong link between crp and obesity . the r is also reduced in these equations for england and the us . for taiwan , women in england and taiwan , but not women in the us , with a higher waist but who are not obese have significantly higher physiological dysregulation compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts . obese women in all three countries have elevated risk and the very obese have even higher risk ( table 5(b ) ) . the alternate biological risk summary measure ( 08 ) yields different relationships between weight and physiological dysregulation in the us and taiwan . in the us , only very obese women have a higher alternate biological risk summary score ( 08 ) . in taiwan , obese and normal bmi and high waist women exhibit higher alternate biological risk summary scores compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts , except when smoking status , physical activity , and use of hypertensives are included .   figures 1(a ) and 1(b ) illustrate the predicted alternate biological risk score ( 08 ) for each weight category for men and women ( respectively ) aged 65 who are nonsmokers , do not engage in physical activity , and are currently taking antihypertensive medication . this figure allows for country comparisons of individuals with these characteristics within each weight category and across weight categories . the predicted values indicate that the us has the highest biological risk score within each respective weight category among men and women of the same age and lifestyle behaviors . with the exception of women in the normal bmi and high waist group , england has the second highest biological risk score within each weight category , followed by taiwan . among 65-year - old women with the noted lifestyle behaviors and with a normal bmi and high waist when we consider the alternate bmi cutpoint for obesity in taiwan ( bmi  27  kg / m ) , our findings for the individual biomarkers and summary measures of biological risk are similar to using the bmi  30  kg / m cutoff for taiwan except that the category normal weight with high waist no longer differs from the omitted category ( results not shown ) . this study observes three general findings about how biological risk is associated with obesity in three countries that differ in lifestyle and culture . first , obesity is associated with physiological dysregulation in all countries with differences in the links between specific indicators of biological risk and obesity . generally , obesity in england is associated with hypertension , dyslipidemia , and elevated glycated hemoglobin ; americans who are obese are not more likely to have hypertension . in taiwan , obese women are more likely to have elevated dbp and obese men have an increased risk of elevated triglycerides and glycated hemoglobin compared to their nonobese , normal waist counterparts . our biological risk summary scores indicate that at all levels of weight physiological dysregulation was highest in the us , followed by england ( with one exception ) , with taiwanese exhibiting the lowest biological risk in all groups among the three countries . second , these relationships remain after controlling for demographic factors , participation in physical activity , and other behavioral factors . third , similar to obese older adults , high waist individuals with normal bmi also exhibit greater physiological dysregulation in all countries compared to their normal bmi and normal waist counterparts . our finding of a higher physiological dysregulation , as shown by the alternate biological risk summary score , in taiwan compared to the us and england could be due to a couple of potential explanations . the prevalence of obesity in the us and england is much higher than in taiwan , indicating an earlier initial rise in obesity relative to taiwan . from 1978 to 2002 , the proportion of obese americans and britons exhibited stark increases ( 1332% and 623% for men and women , resp . ) . the estimates for obesity prevalence in taiwan indicate a recent increase for men but not women . from 19931996 to 2000 - 2001 , the age - adjusted prevalence of obesity rose from 10.5% to 15.9% for men and declined from 13.2% to 10.7% in women . it may be that the lower levels of risk among older adults who have lived longer years with obesity could be a reflection of better pharmacologic control of physiological dysregulation ( e.g. , through statin use ) , which may in turn confer less biological risk in these populations compared to populations of currently obese taiwanese adults who may have more recently begun living with obesity . a second reason for the observed country differences in obesity may be due to differences in dietary habits and lifestyle . the us and england are two modern , western populations whose diets have been influenced by increased industrialization and have over time come to be characterized by high glycemic loads and high fatty acid composition . taiwan , on the other hand , represents a country that has experienced the effects of the industrial and scientific revolutions later than that of the us and england but is currently rapidly undergoing economic development and demographic change . the recent economic changes in taiwan may indicate that obese older adults in taiwan have more recently begun to consume high - fat diets , which could result in greater initial physiological dysregulation associated with access to western - influenced dietary habits . despite controlling for lifestyle behaviors thought to be linked with health , the country differences in obesity and physiological regulation remain . moreover , the consideration of antihypertensives does not alter our substantive conclusions on these associations . this suggests that despite the greater use of medications to treat hypertension in the us , obesity among americans is associated with greater overall biological risk than the other two countries . this is supported by findings from the general population of americans relative to england , which report that the us is faced with greater health disadvantages than england in adulthood   and across the life span . we also note differences in biological profiles of obese individuals between the two westernized countries : the us and england . the excess risk of hypertension associated with obesity in england was not found in the us . these differences may be due to the higher use of medications among americans compared to the english , with about 16% more men and 18% more women in the us aged 65 + taking antihypertensive medication compared to their british counterparts . the greater use of hypertensive medications in the us is also noted when compared to japan and countries across europe . two notable differences in country patterns of the relationship between obesity and physiological dysregulation by sex are found . among men in england and taiwan , the order of magnitude of physiological dysregulation increases with higher weight categories ; however , this is not observed for us men . this difference may be due to our inability to consider statin use in england and taiwan , which may be particularly important in the relationship between obesity and physiological dysregulation for men . conversely , the importance of considering statin use may be less vital to understanding the country differences in the association between obesity and physiological dysregulation among women , given that the relationship for women is more consistent across countries , namely in the us and england . women , underweight corresponds with higher biological risk ( though nonsignificant ) compared to women with normal bmi and normal waist . underweight among men in taiwan is significantly associated with much lower biological risk than their normal bmi and normal weight counterparts . further studies will be required to explore possible explanations for these differences in physiological dysregulation . the higher biological risk observed among normal bmi and high waist individuals relative to normal bmi and normal waist older adults builds upon previous studies that report on alternate indicators of body shape , which vary across countries . the importance of waist circumference is underscored by our current study , as well as a growing body of literature on the predictive value of waist circumference on indicators of health . higher rates of diabetes among older americans compared to britons have been accounted for by high waist circumference as opposed to bmi differences . additionally , increasing waist circumference is more predictive of greater risk of incident diabetes than bmi in middle - aged british men ( and the european prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition ( epic)-potsdam study ) . waist circumference , as an indicator of central fat mass , is thought to be more strongly associated with disease risk , and in our case with physiological dysregulation , compared to bmi , which is considered a cruder index of adiposity . banks and colleagues   cite differences in physical activity , diet and greater psychosocial environmental challenges in america compared to england as potential mechanisms linking central adiposity and type 2 diabetes . our study considers some of these possible mechanisms ( e.g. , physical activity and antihypertensive use ) but finds that they explain little of the relationship between biological risk and adiposity among the three countries . together , these results highlight the importance of considering waist circumference in investigating the links between indicators of health and adiposity . our finding of the biological risks associated with obesity among older taiwanese adults underscores the growing concern for risks associated with obesity in countries rapidly undergoing modernization . in comparing the biological risk of obese individuals among the three countries , we are able to use these international comparisons to our advantage to examine how differences in modernization influence the health of older adults in different populations this may have potential health policy implications that underscore the importance of addressing and controlling the rising obesity epidemic that has become most widespread in countries , like the us and england , that have long experienced high economic growth and in countries currently undergoing rapid economic development . the increasing use of biological information to inform our understanding of health represents an innovative method in biodemography that will further contribute to the testing of current comparative theory and the potential creation of new paradigms surrounding the influence of modernization on health . first is the use of a broad range of biological markers across three large - scale population surveys . the inclusion of biological information as objective precursors of health allows , to some extent , a fairly comparable comparison of indicators of health across the different populations . an exception to this uniform comparison of biomarkers across the three surveys is our use of inflammatory marker crp in the us and england and our inclusion of a different marker of inflammation ( il-6 ) in taiwan . of note , crp seems to be more strongly associated with obesity than il-6 . a growing body of literature has made distinctions between bmi and waist circumference , namely , suggesting that waist circumference is a better indicator of abdominal obesity , which in turn has been associated with obesity - related health risks . our findings generally report a similar association between increased biological risk and ( 1 ) normal bmi and high waist and ( 2 ) obese and high waist . using the us nhanes ,   reported that when both waist circumference and bmi were included in their analyses , only waist circumference was a significant predictor of comorbidity . although this and other studies have suggested that waist circumference may be a better indicator of obesity and risk for adverse health outcomes , our study finds the two indicators to be similarly associated with biological risk across the three countries . first , we examine population - based data from three countries at a single time point . future studies of longitudinal data will allow for further investigations of the potential role of obesity on biological risk observed in the current associations . second , we do not have measures of some lifestyle and medical behaviors for some of the datasets ( e.g. , statin use ) , which likely influence the relationship between obesity and biological risk . as such , we are unable to include such factors in our analyses of all three countries . it is possible that these lifestyle behaviors are key explanatory factors to the noted cross - country differences in obesity - related biological risk . the cross - country differences in the relationship between increased biological risk for individuals who are obese and have a high waist underscore potential differences in health and lifestyle behaviors . these behaviors may be a result of country differences in economic development that we are not able to observe in this study . the country differences in the links between obesity and physiological dysregulation are particularly marked when comparing obesity among taiwanese older adults relative to westernized populations , such as the us and england . further examination of these relationships over time and across other countries will contribute to our understanding of the potential factors responsible for these country - specific variations in biological risk , as obesity becomes increasingly more prevalent and older adults in various countries live more years with obesity and increased adiposity ..
