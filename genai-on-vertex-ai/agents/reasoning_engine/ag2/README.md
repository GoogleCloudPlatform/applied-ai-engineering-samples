# AG2 Multi-Agent Research Notebook on Vertex AI Reasoning Engine

This notebook provides a practical demonstration of utilizing the AG2 (formerly Autogen) framework, a framework for developing and deploying multi-agent AI systems, with Vertex AI's Reasoning Engine to conduct collaborative research using multiple AI agents. This notebook demonstrates the following key features:

## Functionality

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Creates a research team of specialized AI agents, including a Researcher, Data Analyst, Literature Reviewer, and Fact Checker. These agents work together using AG2's group chat functionality to efficiently conduct research and generate reports.

- **Topic Customization:** Allows users to specify the research topic of interest, providing control over the scope and focus of the multi-agent investigation.

- **Remote Deployment:** Leverages Vertex AI's Reasoning Engine for remote deployment and execution of the multi-agent application, ensuring scalability and resource management.

- **Literature Review Generation:** Facilitates the generation of a comprehensive literature review based on the research conducted by the AI agents.

- **Report Persistence:** Provides the option to save the generated literature review to a file for offline review, editing, and collaboration.

## What This Notebook Covers

1. **Environment Setup:** Guides users through installing the necessary dependencies, including AG2 and the Vertex AI SDK, as well as setting up authentication for Google Cloud access.

2. **Configuration:** Explains and demonstrates the configuration of essential parameters, such as the Gemini model to use, project ID, storage bucket, caching seed, and location for deployment.

3. **Topic Definition:** Shows how to specify the research topic for the multi-agent team, empowering users to tailor the research to their specific interests.

4. **Deployment:** Provides instructions on deploying the multi-agent application to Vertex AI's Reasoning Engine for efficient and scalable execution.

5. **Monitoring:** Guides users on how to monitor the deployment progress and status within the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) console.

6. **Report Persistence:** Demonstrates how to save the generated literature review to a file for offline access and further analysis.

This notebook serves as a valuable resource for understanding and implementing multi-agent research workflows with AG2 and deployed on Google Cloud's Vertex AI via the Reasoning Engine.
