    " - **Embedding and Storage**: The processed data is then converted into vector embeddings using a Vertex AI Embeddings model, and these embeddings are stored in Vertex AI Vector Search.\n",
    " - **User Query**: When a user submits a query, it is first rephrased using Vertex AI Gemini and converted into an embedding.\n",
    " - **Retrieval**: The query embedding is used to search the stored embeddings and return the most relevant documents.\n",
