        "\n",
        "1. This notebook uses Generative AI cababilities. Re-running a cell that uses Generative AI capabilities may produce similar but not identical results.\n",
        "2. Because of #1, it is possible that an output from Code Interpreter producess errors. If that happens re-run the cell that produced the coding error. The different generated code will likely be bug free. The `run_code_interpreter` method below helps automate this, but you still may need to rerun cells that generate working code that doesn't perfectly follow the instructions in the prompt.\n",
        "3. The use of Extensions and other Generative AI capabilities is subject to service quotas. Running the notebook using \"Run All\" may exceed  your queries per minute (QPM) limitations. Run the notebook manually and if you get a quota error pause for up to 1 minute before retrying that cell. Code Interpreter defaults to Gemini on the backend and is subject to the Gemini quotas, [view your Gemini quotas here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?pageState=(%22allQuotasTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22base_model_5C_22_22%257D_2C%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22gemini_5C_22_22%257D%255D%22%29%29&e=13802955&mods=logs_tg_staging).\n",
        "4. The Code Interpreter Extension is stateless and therefore every request to Code Interpreter does not have knowledge of previous operations nor files injested or produced in previous steps. Therefore, with any request to Code Interpreter you need to submit all files and instructions for that request to complete successfully.\n",
        "5. The Code Interpreter runs in a sandbox environment. So try to avoid prompts that need additional Python packages to run, or tell the Code Interpreter to ignore anything that needs packages beyond the built-in ones.\n",
        "6. Tell the Code Interpreter to catch and print any exceptions for you, and to suppress UserWarnings and FutureWarnings.\n",
        "7. For debugging the output of the Vertex Code Interpreter extension, it usually helps to copy the error message into the prompt and tell the extension to properly handle that error.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can take a look at [this section](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VCc78QwQLFCi0-C0nrniNx1A2oETPzJI?resourcekey=0-qNxm5xjjWT5sAcpe1gnaQA#scrollTo=Q0ntCZvlY0sH&line=1&uniqifier=1) as an example for points 5-7."
