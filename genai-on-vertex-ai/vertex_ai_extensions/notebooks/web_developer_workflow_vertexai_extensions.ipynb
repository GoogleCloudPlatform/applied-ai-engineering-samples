        "\n",
        "1. This notebook uses Generative AI cababilities. Re-running a cell that uses Generative AI capabilities may produce similar but not identical results.\n",
        "2. Because of #1, it is possible that an output from Code Interpreter producess errors. If that happens re-run the cell that produced the coding error. The different generated code will likely be bug free. The `run_code_interpreter` method below helps automate this.\n",
        "3. The use of Extensions and other Generative AI capabilities is subject to service quotas. Running the notebook using \"Run All\" may exceed  your Queries per minute (QPM) limitations. Run the notebook manually and if you get a quota error pause for up to 1 minute before retrying that cell. Code Interpreter uses Gemini on the backend and is subject to the Gemini quotas, [view your Gemini quotas here](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/quotas?pageState=(%22allQuotasTable%22:(%22f%22:%22%255B%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22base_model_5C_22_22%257D_2C%257B_22k_22_3A_22_22_2C_22t_22_3A10_2C_22v_22_3A_22_5C_22gemini_5C_22_22%257D%255D%22%29%29&e=13802955&mods=logs_tg_staging).\n",
        "4. The Code Interpreter Extension is stateless and therefore every request to Code Interpreter does not have knowledge of previous operations nor files injested or produced in previous steps. Therefore, with any request to Code Interpreter you need to submit all files and instructions for that request to complete successfully.\n"
