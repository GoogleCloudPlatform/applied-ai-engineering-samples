RAG Playground is a tool / framework that aims to solve the following high level goals:

1. Provide a unified interface to experiment with various RAG components and configurations (parsing, chunking, retrieval, answering, etc.).
2. Enable easy comparison of answers generated by various techniques for the same query.
3. Provide automated side-by-side evaluations using first-party and third-party frameworks (e.g., Vertex GenAI Rapid Evals). Includes a voting system to gather user preferences and create a "gold standard" dataset for evaluation.
4. Leverage the generated "gold standard" dataset for evaluating new RAG techniques.
5. Leverage user preferences to select the best technique for specific queries. Utilize these preferences to fine-tune LLMs using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF).
6. Easily extensible toolkit extending across any RAG system, component, or evaluation method. Out-of-the-box support starting with Vertex AI Search and DIY RAG APIs.
